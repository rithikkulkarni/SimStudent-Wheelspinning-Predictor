# 🤖 SimStudent Wheelspinning Predictor

Welcome to our machine learning research extending the SimStudent intelligent tutoring system. This project focuses on real-time prediction of wheelspinning — when a student struggles repeatedly without making progress — within the context of teaching algebra to an AI student.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**How can we detect when learning hits a wall — and help students recover?**  
This project builds a machine learning model to identify **wheelspinning behavior** in real time within the **SimStudent** platform, an AI-powered learning environment developed by Dr. Noboru Matsuda.

The goal is to improve SimStudent’s responsiveness by predicting when a student (or AI agent being taught) is stuck, allowing the system to intervene intelligently and adapt its instruction strategy.

## 🔍 What is Wheelspinning?

*Wheelspinning* is a term from educational data mining that refers to a student putting in effort without making mastery progress. Detecting this early can help avoid frustration and improve learning outcomes.

---

## 🛠 What We Did

- Analyzed interaction logs and learning traces from SimStudent sessions  
- Labeled data using criteria for wheelspinning detection (e.g., performance plateaus, repeated errors)  
- Engineered features based on student responses, timing, and learning curves  
- Trained predictive models to identify wheelspinning events  
- Designed the system to enable real-time prediction within the SimStudent app

## 💡 Key Insight

Early detection of wheelspinning is possible using a combination of **student performance trends**, **problem history**, and **response patterns** — enabling smarter, adaptive tutoring.

## 👨‍🏫 Research Context

This project is being conducted under the mentorship of **Dr. Noboru Matsuda** at **NC State University**, as an extension to the ongoing development of the **SimStudent** educational AI platform.
