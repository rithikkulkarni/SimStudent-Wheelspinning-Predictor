Predictive Modeling for SimStudent Engagement

This project is an extension to the SimStudent project originally created by Dr. Noboru Matsuda. The goal of this project is to utilize data from real studies conducted in middle schools to train a predictive model. This model will help detect when students are potentially wheelspinning or not being productive during their interactions with SimStudent, thereby providing timely interventions and enhancing learning outcomes.
Project Overview

SimStudent is a well-established platform designed to simulate student behavior in learning environments. This extension leverages its rich dataset by applying machine learning techniques to:

    Analyze student interactions.
    Identify patterns associated with unproductive or wheelspinning behavior.
    Provide insights that can inform educators about when and how to intervene.

Features

    Data Integration: Utilizes real-world data from middle school studies.
    Predictive Modeling: Implements algorithms to forecast instances of wheelspinning.
    Actionable Insights: Offers a framework for detecting when a student may be struggling, allowing for proactive support.
